✅ Validation Navigation Rule

During the issue validation process:

The Next and Previous buttons must navigate only through issues that are not yet validated.

Issues that are already validated must be skipped and should not be included in navigation.

Once an issue is validated, it should be immediately removed from the active navigation flow.

Navigation should dynamically update after each validation.

Expected Behavior:

Users can move only between pending (unvalidated) issues.

Validated issues are excluded from Next/Previous navigation.

If no pending issues remain, close the validation modal.


-----------------------------------

✅ Validation Navigation Behavior

Only issues that are pending validation should be available for Next and Previous navigation.

Issues that are already validated must not appear in the navigation flow.

Next/Previous buttons should move only between unvalidated issues.

Validated issues must be automatically excluded.

Expected Result:
Users can navigate only through issues that are still pending validation.

------------------------------------------------
✅ Revalidation Navigation Behavior (Validated/NA Issues)

In the Validated/NA Issues table:

When a lead clicks Revalidate, the issue opens in a new page.

The Next and Previous buttons must navigate only through validated and NA issues.

Navigation should include all issues in the Validated/NA list.

Unvalidated or pending issues must not be included in this navigation flow.

Expected Result:
During revalidation, users can move only between issues that are already validated or marked as NA.

------------------------------------------------
✅ Global Breadcrumb Navigation (All Roles)

Implement a breadcrumb navigation system across the entire website for all user roles (Admin, Lead, Tester).

Requirements:

Breadcrumbs must be visible on all main pages and workflows.

Each breadcrumb item must reflect the actual navigation hierarchy.

All breadcrumb links must use working, real routes (no placeholders).

Clicking any breadcrumb should navigate to the correct page.

Breadcrumbs should update dynamically based on the current route.

Role-based pages should show role-relevant paths.

Example:
Home → Project → Test Cycle → Issues → Validate Issue

Expected Result:
Users can clearly see their current location and navigate back through valid routes using breadcrumbs.
-----------------------------------------------------
✅ Global Input Validation & Field Limits (All Modules)

Implement proper validation rules and input limits for all input fields across the website, including media links, based on their functional requirements.

Requirements:

All form fields must have appropriate frontend and backend validation.

Mandatory fields must be enforced (cannot be submitted empty).

Apply minimum and maximum length limits for text fields (e.g., title, description, comments).

Validate data types (email, number, URL, date, etc.).

Restrict special characters where not allowed.

Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and invalid payloads.

Show clear, user-friendly validation error messages.

For Media Links:

Accept only valid URLs (http/https).

Validate supported platforms/formats (e.g., image, video, drive links).

Set maximum link length.

Verify accessibility (optional: check if link is reachable).

Block unsupported or broken links.

Expected Result:
Users can submit forms only with valid, well-formatted, and secure data, ensuring system reliability and data integrity.

----------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Text Truncation in Issue Tables (All Modules)

Implement text truncation in all issue-related tables across the website to maintain consistent layout and readability.

Requirements:

Apply truncation to long text fields such as:

Issue Title

Description

Module Name

Comments

Remarks

Use ellipsis (...) for truncated content.

Maintain a consistent maximum character/width limit across tables.

Show the full content on hover (tooltip) or on click (modal/popover).

Ensure truncation works on all screen sizes (responsive).

Expected Result:
All issue tables remain clean and readable, with long text properly truncated and accessible when needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------

✅ User Profile – Device Details Management (Backend Enhancement)

Add a Device Details section in the User Profile to allow users to manage multiple devices.

Requirements (Backend-Focused):

Extend the user profile schema to support multiple devices per user.

Each device entry must include:

Device Name/Model

Operating System (OS)

Allow users to add, edit, and delete multiple device records.

Validate device and OS fields (required, max length, supported formats).

Store device details in a structured format (linked table or embedded object).

Expose APIs to:

Fetch user devices

Add new device

Update device

Remove device

Ensure proper authorization (users can manage only their own devices).

Expected Result:
Each user can maintain a list of devices in their profile, which can be used for issue reporting and analytics.
